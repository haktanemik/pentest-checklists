# WordPress Checklist

## WordPress Core Version Detection

1. WordPress core version can be detected from generator tag and via CSS or JS file in the source code of the page.

**Example:**
* &lt;meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.4.2" /&gt;
* style.min.css?ver=5.4.2

## Themes Detection & Enumeration

1. Themes can be detected from via CSS or JS file in the source code of the page.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/themes/HERE/style.css?ver=5.4.2

2. Theme information (such as version) can be detected via readme.txt file.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/themes/HERE/readme.txt

3. It can be detected by performing brute force attack for installed but unused themes.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/themes/HERE # If the theme is used, the returning HTTP response will be different.

4. Information gathering about themes can be collected with WPScan tool.

**Usage:** wpscan --url https://example.com --enumerate vt

## Plugins Detection & Enumeration

1. Plugins can be detected from via CSS or JS file in the source code of the page.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/plugins/HERE/

However, some plugins information is not exposed in the source code, so brute force attack must be done to find all installed plugins.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/plugins/HERE # If the plugin is used, the returning HTTP response will be different.

2. Plugin information (such as version) can be detected via readme.txt file.

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-content/plugins/HERE/readme.txt

3. Information gathering about plugins can be collected with WPScan tool

**Usage:** wpscan --url https://example.com --enumerate vp

## Users Detection

1. Brute force attack on author parameter.

**Example:**
* example.com/?author=HERE # If there is user, the returning HTTP response will be different.

2. WP-JSON REST API

**Example:**
* example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users

3. Brute force attack on login panel. If there is user, the returning HTTP response will be different.

## Brute force attack on Login Panel

1. After wordpress installation, login is by default wp-login.php. With hardening these default paths can be changed. If there is such a case, firstly directory fuzzing should be made and login panel should be determined.

**Hydra:**

**Usage:** hydra -L username.txt -P password.txt www.example.com -V http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location'

**WPScan:**

**Usage:** wpscan â€“url https://www.example.com --wordlist wordlist.txt --username admin

## Other Controls

1. Is directory listing active?

**Example:**
* https://www.example.com/wp-includes
* https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads

2. Can you access XMLRPC?

**Example:**
* https://www.example.com/xmlrpc.php

**Brute force attack via XMLRPC**
* curl -X POST -d "&lt;methodCall&gt;&lt;methodName&gt;wp.getUsersBlogs&lt;/methodName&gt;&lt;params&gt; &lt;param&gt;&lt;value&gt;admin&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param&gt;&lt;value&gt;pass&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;/params&gt;&lt;/methodCall&gt;" https://www.example.com/xmlrpc.php

3. Scanning all ports of the server. For example: Is the database port open to the external?

4. Control of sensitive sensitive files and directory (Directory fuzzing) For example: robots.txt, .htaccess, phpmyadmin, backup/log files

5. Captcha control in areas such as contact form and login form

6. Checking HTTP responses returned from the application. For example, is there version information disclosure?

7. Checking SSL/TLS

8. Checking HTTP security header and cookie flags
