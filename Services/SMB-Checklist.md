# SMB Enumeration
### Port Scanning - Check Service is UP
Nmap can be used for port scanning. Basic nmap command for SMB service check is in the following.

**Example:**
```
nmap -Pn -n -v -sT -p139,445 [ip]
```
### Gathering Hostname
Nmblookup is a tool in the Kali Linux distribution. Nmblookup collects NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS names.

### Checking SMB Properties
Nmap can check SMB mode and SMB properties with basic scripts.

**Example:**
```
nmap -Pn -n -sT -sC -p139,445 [ip]
```
### SMB Share Listing
You can check shared resources with commands in the following.

**Example:**
```
smbmap -H [ip]
```
```
smbclient -L \\\\[ip]
```
```
nmap -Pn --script smb-enum-shares -p 139,445 [ip]
```
### Checking Null Sessions

**Example:**
```
smbmap -H [ip]
```
```
rpcclient -U “” -N [ip]
```
```
smbclient \\\\[ip]\\[sharename]
```
### Checking Known Vulnerabilities

nmap -Pn --script smb-vuln* -p 139,445 [ip]
```
### Automated Enumeration
Enum4Linux is a great tool for SMB Scanning. Enum4Linux checks all SMB Enumeration types with -A (do all enumeration) parameter. Enum4Linux checks for null session, share listing, domain info, password policy and etc.

**Example:**
```
enum4linux -A [ip]
```
